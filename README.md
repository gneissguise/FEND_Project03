===============================

## How to install and run

* Clone this repository into a directory that you have access to:
`git clone https://github.com/gneissguise/FEND_Project03.git`

* Run a simple webserver on the directory that you cloned the project into:
`http-server ./FEND_Project03`

  * _Note:_ if you do not have access to a webserver, you may install `http-server` via npm:
  `npm install http-server -g`

* Open your favorite browser, and navigate to http://localhost:8080/

## How to play

* When you first open the game, you will be brought to the start screen. Your options are:
  * Start Game
  * Help
  * Credits

* Click the __Start Game__ button to launch a new game.

* After clicking __Start Game__, you may choose the character that you wish to play as.
Click the arrow buttons to scroll through the selection of characters, and when you have chosen your
character click start.

* You may now play the game! Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your character around.

* The object of the game is to guide your character across the road into the water.  Try not to get hit
by the bugs!  

* If you are hit by a bug, you will lose a life (heart).  If you lose all three lives, you lose the game.

* Every time you make it to the water, the level will increase and your character will be moved back to the starting point.  For each level the difficulty of the game will increase (meaning the bugs will get faster!)

* Try to see how far you can get!  Some have made it to level 20!  Brag to your friends!

* To pause the game type __P__ or __ENTER__ on your keyboard; to exit, type __ESC__
